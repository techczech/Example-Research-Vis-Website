    "caveat": {
      "title": "Important Data Caveat",
      "content": "The bottom 5 positions (highest poverty) are unfilled in the source data. This is likely due to missing values for countries typically facing extreme poverty (e.g., Niger, Chad, South Sudan). As such, the global challenge may be underestimated in summary statistics."
